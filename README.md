# Integrity360
Source code developed as part of Buidl hackathon on Klaytn Blockchain

We have taken a unique problem statement on how Klaytn Blockchain can solve DEI issues (Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity) in developing nations !

APAC (Asia Pacific) is home to a rich range of people, ethnicities, and cultures, not to mention 60% of the worldâ€™s population. 
However, it is still evolving in showing progress in DEI compared to other parts of the world. (For ex, the concept of mental health has traditionally been overlooked in many APAC countries.)

Our solution Integrity360 is a unique solution built on 12+ Klaytn API features  and Google cloud to track and approve DEI compliance !
